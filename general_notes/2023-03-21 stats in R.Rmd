Deviance = error = residuals

Estimate B0, B1, error

How to fit best fit line
- Minimize sum of squared errors (SSE)    


Yi = (y_i-yHat)*2

SSE+ SSR  = (TSS total sum of squares)

The strength regression has to do with the balance between SSE in relation to TXX 

Assumptions of regression
1. Continuous Y
2. Normally distributed residuals
3. Linear relationship
4. No heteroscedasticity
5. No autocorrelation
